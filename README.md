React components for working with contacts data.



## Contacts Data

These components assume contacts in the form of:

```json
{
  "label": "Main ETH account",
  "notes": "ðŸ’°",
  "createdAt": "2021-05-26T16:03:03Z",
  "modifiedAt": "2021-05-26T16:03:03Z",
  "address": {
    "accountId": "0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb",
    "chainId": "eip155:1"
  }
}
```
You can find the JSON schema in the [repo](https://github.com/fission-suite/contacts/blob/main/src/Schemas/Dawn/Contact.json) from the contacts app, which is live at [contacts.fission.app](https://contacts.fission.app/). In the app you can view and manage your contacts. By default it assumes the contacts like at `private/Documents/Contacts/`.



## Components

To illustrate how easy it is to work with the [webnative](https://github.com/fission-suite/webnative) filesystem, we're making a few React components to easily render contacts in your React app.

```js
import { Contact } from 'fission-contacts-react'
```



## Example

There is an example in the [example](example/) directory, which is also available at [contacts-react.fission.app](https://contacts-react.fission.app). That also serves as an example for the React components from the [Fission UI Kit](https://github.com/fission-suite/kit).
